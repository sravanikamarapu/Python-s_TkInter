The program in which it will first ask you if you want to encrypt a message or decrypt it. Then the program should receive a message from the user.

If the user chooses to encrypt the message, the user’s message will be transformed into a secret code. But if the user chooses to decrypt the message, the program will convert a secret code into a meaningful text.The program rearranges the order of letters in user input so that it cannot be understood by anyone. This can be done by putting the letters in even and odd positions.
The first two letters are swaped with the next two and so on. The code converts encrypted text to decrypted text by reversing the letters according to user input.
